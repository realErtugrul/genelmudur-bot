# genelmudur-bot dev branch
This project was started to help us manage our Telegram community [@programlama](http://t.me/programlama). We are growing and third party bots were well in the past, but we have some special needs that pushed us to create our own bot. The bot is available in Telegram over its username [@genelmudurbot](http://t.me/genelmudurbot), but will only work in our groups at the beginning. 

This is an open source project, however some special plugins or functionalities will be closed source and will not be added to this repository.
